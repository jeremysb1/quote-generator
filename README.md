# Quote Generator

This vanilla JavaScript project, as the name suggests, displays random quotes based on an API call.

Users can click a button to generate new quotes and share a quote via twitter.

The main purpose of this project was to work with backgrorund images, google fonts, and have a container display data dynamically based on user behavior.

While sufficient for learning purposes, it isn't complex enough to put on a portfolio page.
